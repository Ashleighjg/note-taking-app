# note-taking-app

## Description

I was motivated to update the code for this note taker app as part of my bootcamp week11 challenge. This wesite was built to allow a user to save notes. I was able to make a responsive website that allows the user to create and maintain notes.

Once the user has entered in note title and note text into the form, the data is stored in database and displayed. Then the user is able to view the notes and delete them at will.
